          %p Dear Rachel,
          %p In response to your email regarding the name of the vessel, I understand that "MV Queeny" has been rejected, therefore we would like to go with "Bobcat" as the new name.
          %p Thanks
          %p John Smith

          %p To John Smith,
          %p You have submitted an application to register "MV Queeny". Unfortunately this name is deemed unacceptable due to its links with the Royal family. Please reply with a few alternative names.
          %p Yours
          %p Rachel Miles
